iGrok* asks: Are you feeling ________?Are you needing _______? 

Use iGrok in several ways:

1. SELF-EMPATHY (For self-connection and better understanding and self-acceptance in a challenging situation.) Identify and connect with your feelings/emotions and needs/values in a particular situation to replace old habits you might have of judging, blaming, or criticizing yourself. Try out different feelings/needs words until you discover ones that resonate with you. You may experience a felt sense of your body relaxing when you have connected with your feelings and needs.

?2.  EMPATHY FOR OTHERS (For connection and better understanding and acceptance of another person when they are expressing themselves.) Take your time. Breathe, pause, relax, open, and trust whatever wants to emerge. Guess their feelings and their needs in a particular situation to replace any old habits you might have of judging, blaming, correcting, or criticizing them, either silently or out loud. Integrate your guesses within the flow of the conversation. The speaker will most often agree with or clarify your guesses and in doing so will have the experience of being understood. Do not hurry guessing feelings and needs. Remember, give full empathy until you sense the other person is more relaxed and self-connected. At this point, they often are ready to listen to you and to move on to strategies, actions, or requests.  (See four steps below)

See the Four Steps below.

4. PERSONAL CLARITY (For clarifying a situation in your mind.) Using all four steps of NVC can support your ability to respond rather than react.
See the Four Steps below.

FOUR STEPS  (OFNR)

1) Observations…distinct from…Evaluations, Judgments, Labels, Analysis, interpretation Neutral statements of what you see or hear: objective facts without your own subjective filters.

2) Feelings…distinct from…Perceptions, “Victim Verbs” (See the list in the application.) Pure emotions rather than what you think/perceive someone is doing TO you.

3) Needs/Values…distinct from…Strategies, Blame, “Should Thinking”(See the list in the application) Universal life energy, with no reference to specific people, actions, or things.

4) Requests (open to outcome)…distinct from …Demands (using fear, guilt, shame, reward) Present time, doable, concrete, specific, positive actions (a ‘do want’, not a ‘don’t want’).

Two types of requests:

Connection requests for reflection of what you heard me say, and/or… how you are feeling when you hear what I say:

Would you tell me what you’re hearing me say?
Would you tell me how you’re feeling, hearing what I’ve just expressed?
Action/Solution requests for strategies to meet everyone’s needs:

Would you be willing to bring the groceries in from the car?
